<article><h1> Introduction </h1> 
  <p>
Throughout the past few months, I have created personal data through my use of digital media, translated those findings into a data visualization chart using SVG on incscape, and discovered how algorithms are used in digital music apps like Spotify and Pandora, which is shown through an explained video.</p></article>
  
<sectionpd><h1>Personal Data</h1>
  <p>I chose to collect data on my listening and song saving habits from Spotify. Every song that I saved I would note the time of day, the genre, the artist, the song name, the year the song came out, and the song length. From this data, my goal was to get an idea of what songs and genres I was listening to most often, and how my listening styles of music changed throughout the day.</p>
</sectionpd>

<sectiondv><h1> Data Visualization </h1>
  <p>This chart depicts the elements of my data collection. Each note represents a song. The style of the note depicts the length of the song. For example, a sixteenth note is a song that was in between one and two minutes, an eighth note is a song that was in between two and three minutes, a quarter note represents a song that was in between three and four minutes, a half note represents a song that was between four and five minutes, and a whole note represents a song that was over five minutes. The dot on the left side of each note represents which decade that each song was created in. The color of each note decodes which genre each song is described as. Finally, the time of day is used as the x-axis.</p><p> This data visualization helped me figure out that most of the songs I listen to are bluegrass and rock from after the year 2000. It also showed that typically I listen to bluegrass earlier in the day and then as the day progresses I switch to other. </p>

   <p>The explained video aspect of this class takes a look at the methods used by Spotify to collect data of Spotify users. Spotify’s Algorithms look at listening and saving history of individual users, and develop a taste profile. They use this information to make selections of songs that will fit the individual user’s music tastes. These algorithms help them create discover weekly playlists, a playlist of fresh music that are crafted for each individual Spotify user.</p>

It also showed that typically I listen to bluegrass earlier in the day and then as the day progresses I switch to other genres. The length of the song did not seem to affect my saving decision of songs. This data was automatically used by Spotify to create personal discovery weekly playlists based off of my personal listening history. </p>
